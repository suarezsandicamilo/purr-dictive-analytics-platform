# Purr-dictive Analytics Platform

## Project Description

This project, the Purr-dictive Analytics Platform, aims to develop a robust platform capable of ingesting and processing large datasets to generate predictive insights using machine learning algorithms. Focusing initially on the Air Quality (New York City) dataset, the platform will forecast pollution levels and predict Air Quality Index (AQI). The platform is designed for scalability and reliability, leveraging containerization (Docker) for deployment on a chosen cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) and utilizing PostgreSQL for efficient data storage.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **AI/ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
* **Cloud Computing:** AWS/Azure/GCP
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **DevOps:** Docker

## Dataset

* **Primary Dataset:** Air Quality (New York City)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial data exploration will focus on understanding the characteristics of the Air Quality dataset, including:

* Examining trends in air pollution across different boroughs, seasons, and weather patterns.
* Identifying correlations between air quality metrics and factors such as traffic volume, population density, and public health indicators.

## Model Training

The platform will implement and train machine learning models to generate predictive insights:

* Developing and training time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast future pollution levels.
* Training regression models to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on relevant features like weather conditions, time of day/year, and traffic data.

## Deployment

The ultimate goal is to deploy the platform to provide valuable real-time information:

* Building a real-time dashboard that visualizes historical air quality data, displays current conditions, and presents predictive forecasts.
* Implementing an alerting system based on predicted AQI levels to inform the public and relevant health authorities.
